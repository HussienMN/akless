  <h2>1. Motivation, Learning Goals und Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    The up coming modular web is a big game changer. Our own implementation of the modular web is our own framework
    <a href="https://github.com/akless/ccm"><strong>C</strong>lient-side <strong>C</strong>omponent <strong>
    M</strong>odel</a>, shortly <strong><i>ccm</i></strong>. With <i>ccm</i>, you can compose web apps from already
    existing web components, just like Lego brick building. Each web component that is published under a free software
    license increases the functionality of the web as a whole, not a single platform only. In other words: The browser
    is the platform and web components extend the powerful capabilities of the browser. So if you build web components,
    you build it for potentially 3 billion people. Such kind of web components are embeddable in any web-based content
    and can simply be used via a custom HTML tag. There are no restrictions in complexity and application domain. <i>
    ccm</i> allows to develop such kind of web components. This learning unit gives you a quick overview what <i>
    ccm</i> is about and what it is used for. Then we see how you can work with <i>ccm</i>-based web components without
    programming skills.

  <h3>1.1 Learning Goals</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>I know what <i>ccm</i> is and what it is used for.
    <li>I know how I can work with <i>ccm</i>-based web components.
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Requirements</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It's useful but not mandatory to already know the markup language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">
      HTML</a> and its modern successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>.
    <li>It is required to know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> has improved and
      cross-browser incompatibility is no more a reason for exclusion.
  </ul>

  <h3>2.1 Client-side Component Model (<i>ccm</i>)</h3>

  <p>
    Hello, my name is André Kless. I'am the developer of <i>ccm</i> and in this video I want to give you a quick
    overview, what is <i>ccm</i> about. <a href="https://github.com/akless">This</a> is my GitHub page, where you can
    find the code stuff. <strong><i>ccm</i></strong> stands for <strong>C</strong>lient-side <strong>C</strong>omponent
    <strong>M</strong>odel and is a model for composing, embedding and running web components inside the browser. Our
    implementation consists of a single JavaScript framework <i>ccm</i> and many <i>ccm</i>-based web components.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Web Component Cloud (W2C)</h3>

  <p>
    Here you see our ready to use <i>ccm</i>-based web components. We are currently working on places where you can
    find, publish and rate components and where you can construct and compose web apps from them. We call these places
    Web Component Cloud (W2C).
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-2.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.3 Component Informations</h3>

  <p>
    Choose a component to try out a demo and get informations about it. In the near future you can rate and comment and
    create apps out of it directly.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-3.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.4 Creation of an App</h3>

  <p>
    This is another Component for creating an app out of the component we looked at before. Notice, that we choose
    competition as the guiding principle here, so many different ranked components may be offered here for the same
    thing, so that users can find their best choice according to their needs.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-4.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.5 Using created Apps</h3>

  <p>
    Now we have created an app. So where can we use it? The answer is: Everywhere! As a result we get a HTML-based
    embed code, which contains only a script tag and a custom tag. This embed code is now usable in any web-based
    content. You know embed code from Youtube videos. With our embed code we can embed not only videos, but any kind of
    web component. Let's show this inside the german learning platform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILIAS">
    ILIAS</a>.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-5.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.6 Declarative Creation</h3>

  <p>
    Instead of using an input mask for creating an app out of components, you can also create a <i>ccm</i>-based app
    on-the-fly in HTML. Here is an example for creating a quiz.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-6.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <p>
    To use a <i>ccm</i>-based web component, you only have to know the public URL of it's JavaScript file. After that
    file is loaded, the corresponding custom HTML tag is ready to use. As you see we can now create HTML-based
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain-specific languages (DSL)</a>. For example
    we can create such an embedded DSL for digital learning.
  </p>

  <h3>2.7 Cross-platform Realtime Collaboration</h3>

  <p>
    Here is another example of a <i>ccm</i>-based app. The difference is that this app has collaborative elements.
    Let's use the same app in another learning platform. As you see, this results in a cross-platform realtime
    collaboration.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-7.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <p>
    The point is, that you can use web components inside a platform, even if the platform doesn't know about it. If you
    switch to a higher platform version or a different platform the components are working directly without any
    reengineering and migration effort.
  </p>

  <h3>2.8 More complex Apps</h3>

  <p>
    We have experimented with combining web components into more complex web apps.
    <a href="https://kaul.inf.h-brs.de/ccm/we_guest.html">This</a> is an example of a web app for a complete semester
    course, where we have reused components for menu, news, chat, forum and many more like video, quiz and rating.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-8.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.9 Provide as a Mobile Web App</h3>

  <p>
    Each <i>ccm</i>-based app can also be deployed on any mobile devices as mobile web app. This has the advantage that
    people that use our course app could access it inside the learning platform, but also as stand-alone mobile web
    app. Remember: The collaboration works between all instances, no matter from which platform it is accessed.
  </p>

  <h3>2.10 Packaging Content as App</h3>

  <p>
    Let's clarify some terms. In the field of digital learning we distinguish between digital learning content,
    applications and platforms. In case of <i>ccm</i> the platform is the browser. The applications are made up of <i>
    ccm</i>-based web components. But what about the content? We have a content component which allows for packaging
    any web-based content into a <i>ccm</i>-based app. For example: This video is a part of an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Education Resource (OER)</a>, packaging
    both, contents and software as well.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/ccm-overview/image-10.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <p>
    Because the content of this learning unit is packaged as <i>ccm</i>-based app, it can now be reused in any
    web-based content.
  </p>

  <h3>2.11 icOER and ECL</h3>

  <p>
    Notice that interactive and collaborative OERs (icOER) can be built with <i>ccm</i>-based web components. These
    icOERs can be used from any access points. Together with cross-platform collaboration this leads to Embedded
    Collaborative Learning (ECL), as defined in our paper<small><sup>1</sup></small>.

  <h3>2.12 Ask us</h3>

  <p>
    This short video cannot address all aspects. There is much more to talk about. For example data management, user
    authentication, availability and versioning. We have comprehensive concepts for all these aspects. Please contact
    us, if you are interested and want more details. Nevertheless, we want to advance the state of the art of Embedded
    Collaborative Learning and are searching for support to finish our work.
