  <h2>1. Motivation, Learning Goals und Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    <!-- Motivation -->
    The up coming modular web is a big game changer. Instead of building monolithic web applications, you compose web
    apps together from already existing web components, like the Lego way. Each web component that is published under a
    free software license increases the functionality of the hole web, not only of a specific platform. The browser is
    the platform. So if you build a component-based web app, you build it for 3 billion peoples. Such kind of web apps
    are embeddable in any web-based content and can be used in form of a simple HTML tag. There are no restrictions in
    complexity and application domain. Here <i>ccm</i> comes in. It allows you to develop such kind of web components.

    <!--
    For example, if you want to build a learning unit that contains a video and a quiz and the learners should be able
    to comment and rate the video, than you do not start to reinvent the wheel and start developing quiz or commentary
    functionality. Instead you looking for already existing professional web components that fits your needs and
    compose these together.
    -->

    <!-- Learning Goals -->
    This learning unit gives you a quick overview what <i>ccm</i> is and what it is used for. Then we see how you can
    work with <i>ccm</i>-based web components without the need of any programming knowledge.

    <!-- Requirements -->
    Never the less it's useful to already know the markup language HTML(5) and, if you know JavaScript, that you have
    already realized that JavaScript has dramatically improved and cross-browser incompatibility is no more a criterion
    for exclusion.

  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Requirements</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It's useful but not mandatory to already know the markup language HTML(5).
    <li>I know that JavaScript has improved and cross-browser incompatibility is no more a criterion for exclusion.
  </ul>

  <h3>2.1 Client-side Component Model (<i>ccm</i>)</h3>

  <p>
    <b><i>ccm</i></b> stands for <b>C</b>lient-side <b>C</b>omponent <b>M</b>odel and is a model for composing,
    embedding and running web components inside the browser. Our implementation consists of a single JavaScript
    framework <i>ccm</i> and many <i>ccm</i>-based web components.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Web Component Cloud (W2C)</h3>

  <p>
    Here you see our already developed and ready to use <i>ccm</i>-based web components. We are currently working on
    places where you can find, publish and rate components and where you can create web apps out of them. These places
    are the visual interface of that, what we call a Web Component Cloud (W2C).
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/what-is-ccm/image-2.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.3 Component Informations</h3>

  <p>
    Choose a component to try out a demo and get informations about it. In the near future you can rate and comment
    and create apps out of it directly from here.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/what-is-ccm/image-3.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.4 Creation of an App</h3>

  <p>
    This is another Component for creating an app out of the component we looked before. Notice that we have a
    principle of competition here, so there can be a lot of ranked components for the same thing. So different people
    will find the individual one that fits exactly there needs.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/what-is-ccm/image-4.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <h3>2.5 Using created Apps</h3>

  <p>
    Now we have created an app. So where can I use it? The answer is: Anywhere! As a result we get a HTML-based embed
    code, which contains only a script tag and a custom tag. This embed code is now usable in any web-based content.
    Let's show this in a german learning platform.
  </p>

  <h3>2.6 Declarative Creation</h3>

  <p>
    Instead of using a input mask for creation of an app out of a component, you can create an <i>ccm</i>-based app
    on-the-fly in HTML(5). Here is an example for creating a quiz.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/what-is-ccm/image-6.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <p>
    To use a <i>ccm</i>-based web component, you only have to know the public URL of it's JavaScript file. After that
    file is loaded, the corresponding custom HTML tag is ready to use. As you see we can now think about HTML-based
    Domain Specific Language (DSL). For example we have the possibility to define such a DSL for digital learning.
  </p>

  <h3>2.7 Cross-platform Realtime Collaboration</h3>

  <p>
    Here is another example of a <i>ccm</i>-based app. The different is that this app has collaborative elements. Let's
    use the same app in another learning platform. As you see, this results in a cross-platform realtime collaboration.
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/what-is-ccm/image-7.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <p>
    The point is, that you can use web components inside a platform, even if the platform don't know about it. If you
    switch to a higher platform version or a different platform the components are working directly without any
    reengineering and migration effort.
  </p>

  <h3>2.8 More complex Apps</h3>

  <p>
    We also trying out to combine web components to more complex web apps. This is an example of a web app for a complete course,
    where we have reused components for menu, news, chat, forum and many more like video, quiz and rating.
  </p>

  <h3>2.9 Provide as a Mobile Web App</h3>

  <p>
    Each <i>ccm</i>-based app can be also simply provided for any mobile devices in form of a mobile web app. This has
    the advantage that people that uses our course app could access it inside the learning platform, but also quickly
    via mobile web app. Remember: The collaboration works between all people, no matter of the different access point.
  </p>

  <h3>2.10 Packaging Content as App</h3>

  <p>
    Let's clarify some terms. In the field of digital learning we distinguish between digital learning content,
    applications and platforms. In case of <i>ccm</i> the platform is the browser. The applications are made up of the
    <i>ccm</i>-based web components. But what about the content? We have a content component which allows you to
    package any web-based content as a <i>ccm</i>-based app. For example: This video is a part of an Open Education
    Resource (OER).
  </p>

  <ccm-le-img src="https://akless.github.io/akless/ccm/what-is-ccm/image-10.jpg"></ccm-le-img>

  <p>
    Because the content of this learning unit is packaged as <i>ccm</i>-based app, it now can be reused in any
    web-based content like already explained before.
  </p>

  <h3>2.11 icOER and ECL</h3>

  <p>
    Notice that you are able to build interactive and collaborative OERs (icOER) with <i>ccm</i>-based web components.
    People can use these icOERs from different access points. Together with the aspect of the cross-platform collaboration
    this leads to what we call Embedded Collaborative Learning (ECL). See our paper to see the definition of ECL.
  </p>

  <h3>2.12 Ask us</h3>

  <p>
    This short video cannot address all aspects. There is many more to talk about. For example things like data management,
    user authentication, availability and versioning. We have comprehensive concepts for many things. Please contact us,
    if you interesting and want more details how this exactly works. Never the less, we want to bring it further and
    searching for possibilities to finish our research and work. Our project only allows this until the beginning of
    next year 2018.
